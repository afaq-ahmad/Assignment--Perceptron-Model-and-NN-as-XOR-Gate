# Task 1: Perceptron Model for Binary Classes Classification

We have implemented perceptron model for binary classes classification. This perceptron takes 2D points as input and classifies it as belonging to either class 0 or 1. Perceptron model build in these steps:

1.	Parameters Initialization

2.	Model Training:

        a.	Multiplication of weights and input data

        b.	Weight updating (gradient descent)

### Steps:
        -Parameters Initialization
        -Model Training
        -Estimated line can correctly classify might not agree with the ground-truth boundary
        -Sometimes boundary oscillating between two solutions and not reaching 100% accuracy
        -Number of epochs required to converge in for both the original and the modified algorithm

### Steps:
        -Implemention Details
        -Modified Accuracy over time
        -Visualize the decision boundaries
        -Linear classifier is still a good choice for this dataset
        
# Task 3: 3-Layer Neural Network like XOR Gate

### Steps:
        -Neural Network Structure
        -Initialize the model's parameters
        -Forward Propagation
        -Compute loss
        -Backward Propagation
        -Minimum number of neurons needed in the hidden layer for successful training
        -When there are too many neurons in the hidden layer
